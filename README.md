# Twitter universal tracking pixel with custom page

There is two types of Twitter ad tag. Universal and Single Page Event.
Recomended solution is universal tag, by default Twitter tag track any page using your current URL, but they didn't allow customize URL value, thanks Twitter!.

For add custom URL values using Univeral Tag I created this script. Useful if you want to track clicks events or your site if full AJAX.
